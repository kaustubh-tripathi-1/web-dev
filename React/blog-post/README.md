Follow these steps to get BlogSmith up and running locally:

    Note: Use --legacy-peer-deps flag to ignore peer dependency conflicts as the used version of tinymce is not fully compatible with react-v19.

   - Note the **Project ID** and **Endpoint** from the Appwrite Console.
   - Configure the necessary collections and permissions for users and posts (refer to Appwrite docs for details).

4. **Configure Environment Variables**
   Create a `.env` file in the root directory and add your Appwrite configuration:
   ```env
   VITE_APPWRITE_ENDPOINT=https://cloud.appwrite.io/v1
   VITE_APPWRITE_PROJECT_ID=your_project_id
   ```

5. **Run the Development Server**
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   # or
